# Won't You Be My Neigh-bot? 

#### By Ryan Bass (theryanbass@gmail.com)

### This is our third project with Epicodus, demonstrating loops, TDD, Javascript, and some new methods.

## Technologies Used

* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* Javascript

## Description

This web application takes a number from the user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user's inputted number with some substitutions made within a specified range. If a number with a "1" in it, it will return "Beep!", if a "2" is in it, "Boop!" will replace the prior string. If there is a "3" in the number, "Won't you be my neighbor?" as a string will replace any string previously there. Otherwise, the number in the range will be returned.

For example, if the user inputted "2, 52, 13, 0", the output would be "Beep!, Beep!, Won't you be my neighbor?, 0".

### Setup/Installation Requirements

* git clone this repository to your computer.
* Run / open "index.html" in a supported browser.
 
 #### Tests
Describe: beepBoop()

Test: "It should return an array with a 0 if the number 0 is inputted"
Code: beepBoop(0);
Expected Output: 0
